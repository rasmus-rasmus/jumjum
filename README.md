# jumjum

This is jumjum - a small hobby project in which I implement various geometrical algorithms just for the fun of it!

### Building the project

To build the project make sure you're at the root of the project and run

```
make build-project
```

### Running tests

So far I've just collected all tests in a single test script. Run them with:

```
make test
```

### Playground

I've also included a playground executable:

```
make playground
```
